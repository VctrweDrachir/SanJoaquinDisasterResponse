	<h3>   I. Introduction</h3>
	
	
	<br>
	<p id="Intro">
		 The Philippines is near the West Pacific  Basin(busiest typhoon belt in the world). The <br> Philippines is also surrounded by the Pacific ocean, West Philippine sea, Bashi channel, and the <br> Celebes sea. Due to the Philippinesâ€™ geographical location, it is subjected to 20 or more <br>typhoons a year. The Typhoon Haiyan,for example, impacted our economy (we lost $5.8 <br> billion).Of course, many people know that the Philippines is subjected to many typhoons every <br> year and also how to be safe from typhoons. Some people, however, do not follow evacuation <br> orders from the LGU. They choose to stay at their houses even though it is very dangerous. We <br> need to educate people about the importance of evacuation. My local area is also experiencing <br> Covid-19 problems. Cases here in San Joaquin, Pasig are growing day by day.

	<h3> II. Discussion of the Problem</h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		The Philippines and NCR experience typhoons every year; therefore, San Joaquin also <br> experiences those. San Joaquin is not a flood prone area. If ever 3, 4, and 5 typhoon signals <br> strike, some houses might be destroyed. There are many non-engineered houses or old houses <br> in the San Joaquin area and typhoons could easily destroy those kinds of houses because of <br>strong winds. People might need to evacuate to certain evacuation centers. We know we have <br> Covid-19 problems  in San Joaquin. Evacuation centers might be crowded, so Covid-19 problems <br> might worsen. Social distancing and some guidelines might not be followed. The effects of <br> typhoons and Covid-19 could even be a greater problem, since both of them could be a threat <br>to the lives of the people. We must plan out how we can mitigate the effects of Covid-19 and <br> the typhoons accordingly.

	<h3>III. Mitigation </h3>
	<br>
  <br>
	<h4>A. Geographical Location</h4>
	<br>
    <p>
		  -Some parts are far from the Pasig River, while others are near.<br>
		  -There are flood walls around the river that could mitigate the effects of the overflowing of the river.<br>
		  -San Joaquin will not experience the overflowing of the Pasig River.<br>

   <h3>VII. About</h3>
  <br>
  <br>
 <p>
  A. We need to practice DRRM cycle to prepare for future typhoons. We can mitigate <br>the effects of typhoons, by identifying the geographical location and building<br> typhoon-proof evacuation centers. We should prepare the things that the people<br> may need for the evacuation. We should coordinate with government agencies <br>that could respond after a serious typhoon. Lastly, we need to rebuild our <br>economy and broken infrastructures. As a SK chairman, we need mitigation plans <br> for these disasters so we can be prepared. Failing to do so might result in worse <br> damages and the death of many.
